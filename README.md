**Data-DPath-Flatten** is Copyright (C) 2022, Robert Wohlfarth

This module converts an arbitrary Perl data structure into a flat list of 
key/value pairs. The keys are `Data::DPath` path strings that reach the 
corresponding value.

I wanted to copy raw data files of varying structure into an SQL database. In
combination with other modules, I can read JSON, XML, Excel, or CSV data. Then
store them in the exact same SQL table.
